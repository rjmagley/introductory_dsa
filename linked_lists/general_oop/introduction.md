# Introduction to Linked Lists

## Objectives
- Learn about linked lists, the data structure that is the focus of this section

## Linked Lists
Linked lists are a data structure that is not, strictly speaking, common in web development. We are, however, going to spend a significant amount of time discussing linked lists for three reasons:

- Linked lists offer an excellent introduction to object-oriented programming in JavaScript, and thus an excellent introduction to creating your own data structures when necessary.
- The fundamentals of how and why linked lists work enable you to better understand other data structures you'll see and work with later in your careers, like trees and graphs. The implementation and use of these data structures is similar to that of linked lists, and trees and graphs solve many problems in programming. You may not need to implement them from scratch, but the theory of them is important.
- Questions about linked list implementations are not uncommon in the interview process - "reversing a linked list" is a common joke amongst developers that has a basis in reality. Data structures like linked lists are part of the curriculum for computer science students, and you'll need at least a passing familiarity with them just in case.

Before we can delve deeply into linked lists, however, we must first cover object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript, which we'll cover in the next section. Even if you are already familiar with these principles from previous learning you've done, you should pay attention to this section - you may be familiar with OOP principles in JavaScript, but using an older version of the language, and you'll want to be familiar with how we're presenting and writing it so that the assignments later will make sense.
