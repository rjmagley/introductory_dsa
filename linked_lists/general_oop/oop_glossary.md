## OOP Glossary

We've thrown a lot of terms at you in the past few modules. Below is a brief glossary of the important terms here. It's okay if you occasionally make a mistake when talking about OOP - from context, people will generally know what you intend to say. However, the more precise we are with our language on this topic, the easier it is to work with it.

**class** - the organization of a data structure; a description of data and the behavior associated with that data.

**constructor** - 

**instance** - one specific collection of data of a given class. In this section you'll see us say things like "instance of *X*", where X is a specific class. The number `341` is an instance of the Number class in JavaScript, the string `"banana"` is an instance of the String class, the array `[4, 6, 21, 7]` is an instance of the Array class.

**object** - a collection of data and behavior. "Object" is a very generic term; remember, however, that JavaScript uses the term "object" to explicitly refer to a collection of key/value pairs. Be careful when you're talking about JavaScript to be specific.
