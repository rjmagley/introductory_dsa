# Introduction

Welcome to the Algorithms section of your course! The material in this section is designed to take your knowledge of JavaScript, as well as your knowledge of computer programming in general, and elevate you to the point where you can start to feel comfortable tackling larger and more abstract problems.

This section focuses primarily on JavaScript, but be aware that the secondary purpose of this material is to improve your overall knowledge of computer science and programming. Many concepts and patterns in JavaScript apply in other languages - programming languages can generally all express the same ideas, just using different syntaxes. While we will be pointing out a few things unique to JavaScript throughout this section, know that in general this information is useful no matter what language you work in - if you are familiar with programming in JavaScript, it is not as difficult as it may seem to start working in Python, C#, Java, Go, Rust or any other language!

## Don't I Already Know JavaScript?

You may be thinking to yourself, "Didn't we talk about JavaScript in Web Fundamentals?", and while it is true that you have been *introduced* to JavaScript, these readings and assignments are designed to give you a much greater depth of knowledge. While you may know the basics of this material already, whether it be from your Programming Basics or Web Fundamentals courses or other study you've done, you're likely to learn a fair amount of knowledge here!

Do remember that you are not expected to memorize all this material as you read it - programming literacy comes over time, and the more you use the material, the more you will memorize it naturally. You may wish to come back to these readings from time to time as a form of review or quick reference.

Keep in mind, however, that the best way to learn to code is by *writing code*. Even if the code has problems, learning to fix those problems - either through your own experimentation or working together with assistance from someone else - is the best way to learn. Again, don't feel like you have to memorize sections of this material before starting assignments. Reviewing this material may be best saved for when you are truly stuck on a problem and need something to remind you of how something works.
