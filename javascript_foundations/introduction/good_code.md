# What Is Good Code?

## Objectives
- Know what to take away from this course
- Learn what makes a good programmer who produces good code
- Learn why this course is laid out the way it is

Before we get too far into this course it is worth bringing your attention to a few facts that all programmers, of all skill levels, should keep in mind.

Your most likely destination if you want to be a developer or software engineer is at a mid-sized or large company in a junior developer role. You will be working on a team, among other teams. The overall project you work on may be solely your team's responsibility, or it may have several teams working on different parts of it. It is likely that the project you work on will have been under development for months, if not years - many people will have worked on it, some of whom are more than likely no longer with the company. In order for this project to be at all functional, and for these teams to get *any* work done, they need to be focused not just on producing code that *works*, but good code.

## What Is Good Code?

Good code should have these qualities:

- It should be *well-organized*. File names, function names and variable names should all make sense to someone who is coming into a project for the first time. It should follow a style guide, either the official one for a language or a commonly-accepted guide; everyone in the organization should be on the same page as to how the code for the project is organized. When a bug is found in a program and needs to be fixed ASAP before it affects users, a well-organized codebase will help a programmer identify and solve the problem with minimal barriers.
- It should be *readable*. Put another way, it should be *obvious* as to how it works, at least to a programmer of equivilent skill level. As a very new programmer, this may seem impossible! Programmers who are of roughly the same level of experience in a particular language or framework, however, should be able to look at each other's work and understand it without too much trouble. All programming languages have interesting quirks, fancy tricks, or otherwise impressive but non-intuitive ways of solving problems - and unless this is important for efficiency, it's best to avoid them. Remember that there is a future where someone has to fix *your* code after you've left your position; ideally, they will be able to do so without having to pick apart a mess you've left them.
- It should be *efficient*. Functions you write may end up needing to execute on a server thousands of times a minute, competing for memory and processor time with other functions and programs. Increasing the efficiency of your code can have a direct impact on your company's bottom line by saving time and money.

Ideally we want to maximize all three of these qualities, but in particular, efficiency can be a problem: bleeding-edge efficient code isn't always particularly readable or easy to understand. Thankfully, extremely efficient code isn't a priority at this point in your learning - as you become more experienced, your code will naturally become more efficient.

The key things you should focus on during this course are **organization** and **readability**. We mention this in particular because there will be readings here and there throughout this course that feature code that may not be the most readable; typically, this is shown to you as an example of something that is *possible*, but it is not a sign that we *reccomend* writing code in that way. Not all programmers are focused on organization and readability; when trying to solve problems online, you may stumble across code that is hard to understand, or purposefully written so that the writer can show off their knowledge.

## Conclusion

Some things in this reading may not immediately make sense - sometimes, we need to learn *about* a topic and then let it sit in the back of our brains for a bit until we're ready to actually make use of it. Similarly, there are some concepts you can learn about, but the knowledge won't really stick until you have to use it in a real-world scenario. In some ways, some of this reading is not for you to immediately learn from, but to get you ready to learn more quickly later.

Likewise, some things we show you are meant to be cautionary - we are trying to show you not just how to write code, but how to write good code. Sometimes this means that you need to see *bad* code as well, as an example of what not to do. Not everyone agrees one hundred percent on what is good and bad when it comes to code, which is why you will likely see examples in your career that will leave you scratching your head.

Remember that the purpose of this course is not just to introduce you to programming concepts, but to help prepare you to be a better programmer in the months and years to come. Feel free to revisit this material after graduation, as you're preparing for the job hunt - some of this reading may be even more valuable to you at that point.
