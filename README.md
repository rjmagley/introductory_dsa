# Introductory DSA Content

Years of teaching taught me something really important - *good* reading material and examples for introductory programmers are scarce.

This repo is a collection of notes and examples I've created to reference when writing assignments, to give to students who need a quick explanation in a situation where I'm not available for a synchronous conversation, or just to remind myself of particularly clever examples for things.

At some point I'd like to expand on these notes and turn them into a website - a little free course for people new to programming, perhaps to act as a refresher for bootcamp students after their programs, or college grads who have realized that their introductory skills are a little rusty. At this point in my life, though, I just don't have energy for this task!

So rather than keep these to myself, I'll release them under a very permissive license. Feel free to use this information while learning or teaching, integrate it into your own introductory courses, or do whatever else you'd like with it. At some point in the future, I'll take this content and update it and run it through a static site generator as a proper project; for now, this is just available to you.
